## ‚ú® Features

- **Automated Summarization:** Uses a BioBART model (`Vrajk/mri-impressions`), fine-tuned on clinical notes from the **MIMIC-IV Radiology dataset from PhysioNet**, to generate a concise "raw impression".
- **AI-Powered Enhancement:** Employs an expert AI (GPT-4 via Azure) to review both the original findings and the raw impression, creating a complete, professionally formatted final report.
- **PDF Processing:** Utilizes the `unstructured` library to automatically extract clinical findings from uploaded PDF reports.
- **Input Validation:** Includes a preliminary AI check to ensure that the input text is relevant to MRI findings before processing.
