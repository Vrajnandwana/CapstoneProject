Prominent bilobed paramedial extra-axial mass along the convexity centered at the level of the posterior frontal 
and anterior parietal lobes with prominent posterior dural tail and occlusion of the adjacent superior sagittal sinus. 
Prominent surrounding reactive edema, left greater than right. Mild lateral shift but no herniation. Smaller 
extraaxial mass overlying the right mid temporal lobe. 
2. Atypical meningioma including hemangiopericytoma or variant or malignant subsidence of meningioma. Other 
less likely considerations include extra-axial dural based metastasis, lymphoma and less likely solitary fibrous 
tumor.
